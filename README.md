Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
How to create a Python package
How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
How to serialize and deserialize a Class
How to write and read a JSON file
How to manage datetime
What is an UUID
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function

0. README, AUTHORS mandatory
Write a README.md:
description of the project
description of the command interpreter:
how to start it
how to use it
examples
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference Docker’s AUTHORS page
Also, we strongly encourage you to use branches and pull requests on Github - it will help you as team to organize your work

1. Be PEP8 compliant! mandatory
Write beautiful code that passes the PEP8 checks.

Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone

2. Unittests mandatory
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ python3 -m unittest discover tests
...................................................................................
...................................................................................
.......................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 189 tests in 13.135s

OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$
Note that this is just an example, the number of tests you create can be different from the above example.

3. BaseModel mandatory
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel
